# Compiling Alchemy Next on Windows

This is an older guide and was initially created as there were many guides on how to compile Firestorm Viewer but not Alchemy

These instructions are more-less historical, and you should follow the [official website](https://alchemyviewer.org/docs/build/Windows)'s build guide.

# Acknowledgments & Credits

I would like to thank the [TPV Self Compilers](secondlife:///app/group/549937c8-f6b2-ff0c-12c6-5a2f342b174d/about) group in Second Life which helped me a handful.

HUGE thank-you to Rye for their support and updating builds quickly.
Practically hand-holding throughout this process (but at least we got a guide now)

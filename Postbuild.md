# Post Build

Once you've successfully compiled the viewer, it's recommended that you create a branch to do all your changes (easily to revert if you muck up).

```powershell
D:\secondlife\\viewers\\tpv\\alchemy\-viewer\\alchemy\-next> git branch -b mycoolfeature
```

Now play with the code add some features! Open to suggestion for neat features.
